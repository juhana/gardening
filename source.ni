Book Player's mood

[this is the mood of the player that goes up and down when things happen during the game. The syntax to change it is a bit counterintuitive: "increase the mood of the player" actually makes it worse.

Checking the adjectives ("if the player is happy" etc) returns true if the player has AT LEAST that level of mood; for example, "the player is angry" is true also if the player is despaired or suicidal. This is also "wrong way around" since if you are angry, you are always suicidal (should be the other way around).]

The player has a number called mood. The mood of the player is 0.

To decide whether the player is happy:
	decide yes.
	
To decide whether the player is doubtful:
	if the mood of the player > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

	decide no.
